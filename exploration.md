# Phase II — Exploration
Phase II looks to introduce students to the various subfields in computational biology. Each course is designed around a track that can be followed for Phase III and Phase IV. This is the smallest phase and will have courses that lightly touch on the history, purpose, motivation, and current state-of-the art in each Area.

## Introduction
Computational Biology is a rapidly growing field with many subfields/specializations cropping up all the time due to the advancement of experimental technology as well as the availability & diversity of open source biological data that can be leveraged for *in silico* work. We have broken down computational biology in a way that we hope can lead learners to their interests, but understand that this is not all encompassing of computational biology as a field. It's also important to note that there's a good chance some people working in computational biology are very good at multiple areas we have here which is awesome! We by no means want learners to syphon themselves into a single category, but rather provide a framework for what may pique their interests. We believe that over time learners will probably find they needs some combination of area profiency for their interests and hope that they continue to reference each section as they grow. Here we hope to expose learners to the basics of each major category so they can continue to follow their interests. With that, this will be the final section that. we recommend completing from start to finish. All other sections you can complete only which areas interest you.
