# Foundations

## Computer Science

### Suggested Materials

#### Basic Computer Science & Your First Programming Language
[Khan Academy Digital Information](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/ap-computer-science-principles/x2d2f703b37b450a3:digital-information)<br>
[w3 Schools – Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp)<br>
[UCSC Python for Data Science](https://www.edx.org/course/python-for-data-science-2?index=product&queryID=d4cc93fac2ec7c90994da2622706b831&position=1)<br>

#### Bash & Version Control (Git)

[GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart)<br>
GitHub is the de facto code sharing platform in the world.

[Data Science at the Command Line – Jeroen Janssens](https://www.datascienceatthecommandline.com/2e/)<br>
Though you've likely already done a little command line work in the GitHub Tutorial & Python for Data Science Course, this free book by Jeroen Janssens has made a wonderful introduction to using the command line for data science. Reading through and coding along with this book will make you a star as using the Unix command line for all things data science. Moving forward you will understand much more about the documentation surrounding many of the softwares you will use as it is common to use the command line for basic scripting as a computational biologist. For the purposes of foundation building my recommendation is completing up to Chapter 8, though of course you can always do the entire book!
